Given the limitations of the global positioning systems at indoors new solutions have been developed adapted to these situations, with a smaller scale and different backgrounds.
Among the technologies used, Ultra-wide Band, which uses pulses of at least 500MHz bandwidth, has been gaining traction as it is lowly intrusive and highly effective in a saturated electromagnetic spectrum giving a precision in the order of centimeters depending on the scenario.

In this work two locations are chosen, with ideal and non-ideal conditions, to evaluate the precision of the DecaWave MDEK1001 commercial kit using a robot.
Testing various setups in both scenarios, the performance of the kit in several situations was compared to determine how obstacles affect the position estimations it provides.
